TO TEST OUR MODELS YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE DATASETS FIRST:

KDD CUP 99(the complete one): https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

NSL KDD: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd
P.S: you need to merge KDDTrain+ and KDDTest+ and name it KDDmerged

put the datasets and the field names.csv and the code in the same directory and then run the code to test the models

You will see the resuls in the command line and then two figures will be plotted.
